Wskazówki:
- This button is inactive if MSI Kombustor is not installed, please visit https://msi.com/page/afterburner to download and install the latest version of MSI Kombustor.
- Please remember that stability testing is not an exact science so there is no absolutely ideal and 100% trustworthy stability testing application. So use the Kombustor as a helper when overclocking the system, but always remember to double check the results with real 3D applications.
