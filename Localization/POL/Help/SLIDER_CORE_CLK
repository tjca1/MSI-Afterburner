Adjusts master GPU core clock.

Wskazówki:
- When GPU settings synchronization mode is enabled in <General> tab in advanced properties, any changes applied to the master GPU are also applied to all similar GPUs installed in the system.
- When adjusting core and shader clocks independently please remember that the minimum allowed shader to core clock ratio is limited by hardware. Attempt to drive the ratio out of range may prevent the clocks from applying.
- When this slider is focused, you may use cursor keys on your keyboard to finetune the clock.
- You may click the adjacent edit field to directly type in a desired clock.
