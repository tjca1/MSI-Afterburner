W³¹cza niskopoziomowy interfejs dostêpu do sprzêtu
Allows %PRODUCTNAME% to use low-level driver for accessing graphics hardware. Low-level access provides the most effective hardware monitoring implementation and extends hardware monitoring and control possibilities beyond the limits of graphics card drivers. However, when low-level access to hardware is in use some badly designed system applications (e.g. infamous Punkbuster client for Battlefield : Bad Company 2) may cause serious stability issues due to their unauthorized access to hardware mapped memory ranges. 
You may use this option to troubleshoot such issues, but it will also reduce performance of hardware monitoring module and some hardware monitoring or control features will be lost.
