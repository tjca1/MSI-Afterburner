Wskazówki:
- Be careful when applying overclocking profiles on the fly during 3D application runtime. Depending on graphics card model and display driver architecture, it may cause side effects and reduce system stability.
- Some applications (e.g. F.E.A.R.) may purposely block hotkeys by breaking low-level keyboard hook chains.
- Some hotkey combinations (e.g. <1>...<5>, <Ctrl>+<1>...<Ctrl>+<5> and <Ctrl>+<D>) are reserved and cannot be used.
