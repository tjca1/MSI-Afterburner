Auxiliary voltage 
Adjusts master GPU auxiliary voltage. Depending on graphics card model the voltage can be represented either excplicitly or as an offset added to base voltage. Signed values represent the offset whilst unsigned values represent absolute voltage.

Wskazówki:
- Auxiliary voltage independently feeds additional graphics card components: GPU memory bus on AMD graphics cards and PCIE bus with crystal on NVIDIA graphics cards. In general terms it is an additional voltage, allowing increasing graphics card overclocking abilities a bit.
- Voltage control is locked by default due to safety reasons. If you understand and accept the risks of using voltage control you can unlock it in advanced application properties.
- When GPU settings synchronization mode is enabled in <General> tab in advanced properties, any changes applied to the master GPU are also applied to all similar GPUs installed in the system.
- Voltage control is available on limited set of graphics card models equipped with programmable voltage regulation module. Please refer to documentation to get full list of graphic card models supporting voltage adjustments.
- When this slider is focused, you may use cursor keys on your keyboard to finetune the voltage.
- You may click the adjacent edit field to directly type in a desired voltage.
