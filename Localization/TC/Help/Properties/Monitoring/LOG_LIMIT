Stop logging when log size exceeds this value 
Allows defining an optional limit for maximum log file size. When the limit is exceeded logging process can be automatically terminated.

Hints:
- %PRODUCTNAME% saves history in native RivaTuner log file format. You may use RivaTuner to view log files recorded with %PRODUCTNAME%. 
- Hardware monitoring history logging is not absolutely free in terms of performance, some CPU and is required on each log update iteration to flush data to HDD. 
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
