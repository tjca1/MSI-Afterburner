Override group name
By default the values displayed in the On-Screen Display and Logitech keyboard LCD display are groupped by short sensor name. This option allows overriding default group names. 

Hints:
- Some group names (e.g. <Framerate> graph group name) are dynamic and cannot be overriden.
- Single symbol group names can be used to group values without displaying a group name.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
