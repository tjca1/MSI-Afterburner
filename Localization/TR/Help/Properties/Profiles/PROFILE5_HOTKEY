Profile slot 5 hotkey
Allows defining global hotkey for loading and applying the profile from profile slot 5.

Hints:
- Be careful when applying overclocking profiles on the fly during 3D application runtime. Depending on graphics card model and display driver architecture, it may cause side effects and reduce system stability.
- Some hotkey combinations (e.g. <1>...<5>, <Ctrl>+<1>...<Ctrl>+<5> and <Ctrl>+<D>) are reserved and cannot be used.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
