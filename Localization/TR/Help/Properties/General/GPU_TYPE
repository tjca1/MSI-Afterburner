Graphics processor type
Some graphics card models may use different types of graphics processors (e.g. high-leakage and low-leakage GPUs) with different default voltages and different 3D voltage control approaches. You may need to use this option to select your graphcis processor type and provide proper voltage control.   

Hints:
- Graphics processor type selection affects currently selected master GPU only, please re-open this window after changing master GPU selection to select new GPU type for it.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
