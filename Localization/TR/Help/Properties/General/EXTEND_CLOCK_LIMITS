Extend official overclocking limits
By default overclocking limits in AMD Catalyst Control Center and in all overclocking tools using official AMD Overclocking implementation are rather low and defined by AMD VGA BIOS.
This option may help extending the limits without altering them in VGA BIOS. Please take a note that the limits are being extended only for graphics cards connected to Windows desktop.
Also, please keep in mind that the limits must be re-extended after installing new AMD display drivers.

WARNING! Use this option at your own risk! Both MSI and AMD will not provide you any support on it in any form including questions in the forums.

Hints:
- This option is only active if there is at least one supported AMD graphic card installed in the system.
- Reboot is required to apply changes after toggling this option.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
