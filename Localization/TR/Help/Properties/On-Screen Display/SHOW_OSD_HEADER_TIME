Show system time
Allows showing system time in the On-Screen Display.

Hints:
- Enabling this option will cause additional %SERVERPRODUCTNAME% process to be automatically started. The server provides On-Screen Display rendering services to 3D applications and it cannot be unloaded until this option is disabled.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
