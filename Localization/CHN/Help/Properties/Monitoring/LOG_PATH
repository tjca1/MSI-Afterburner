Log path
Displays and allows editing path to log file.

Hints:
- MSI Afterburner saves history in native RivaTuner log file format. You may use RivaTuner to view log files recorded with MSI Afterburner. 
- Hardware monitoring history logging is not absolutely free in terms of performance, some CPU and is required on each log update iteration to flush data to HDD. 
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
