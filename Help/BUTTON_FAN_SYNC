Synchronize fan speeds
Allows synchronized or asynchronous GPU fan speed adjustment on graphics cards with multiple independent fan controllers. 
When synchronization is enabled all GPU fans are running at the same speed in fixed or software automatic fan speed modes. In default automatic mode fans are always asynchronous.
