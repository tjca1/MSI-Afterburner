Allows linked or independent core and shader clock adjustement.

Hints:
- Independent shader clock adjustment is available only on NVIDIA GeForce 8, 9 and 200 series graphics cards. Shader and core clocks are linked with hardwired 2x ratio on GeForce 400 series graphics cards. ATI graphics cards don't support independent shader clock adjustment.
- When adjusting core and shader clocks independently please remember that the minimum allowed shader to core clock ratio is limited by hardware. Attempt to drive the ratio out of range may prevent the clocks from applying.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
