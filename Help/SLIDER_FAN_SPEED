Fan Speed 
Adjusts master GPU fan speed.

Hints:
- When GPU settings synchronization mode is enabled in <General> tab in advanced properties, any changes applied to the master GPU are also applied to all similar GPUs installed in the system.
- Fan speed control is not available if graphics card is not equipped with fan controller chip and (or) controllable cooling system.
- <Auto> button must be unchecked in order to control the fan directly.
- When this slider is focused, you may use cursor keys on your keyboard to finetune the speed.
- You may click the adjacent edit field to directly type in a desired speed.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
