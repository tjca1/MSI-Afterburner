Screen capture hotkey
Allows defining global hotkey for capturing a screenshot.

Hints:
- Enabling this option will cause additional %SERVERPRODUCTNAME% process to be automatically started. The server provides screen capture services to 3D applications and it cannot be unloaded until this option is disabled.
- Some hotkey combinations (e.g. <1>...<5>, <Ctrl>+<1>...<Ctrl>+<5> and <Ctrl>+<D>) are reserved and cannot be used.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
