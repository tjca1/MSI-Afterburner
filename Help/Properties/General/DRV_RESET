Reset display mode on applying unofficial overclocking
Due to bug in the AMD Catalyst drivers, display may flicker after applying unofficial overclocking until display mode change. You may enable this option as a workaround to force display mode to be reset after applying unofficial overclocking.

Hints:
- This option is only active if there is at least one supported AMD graphic card installed in the system.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
