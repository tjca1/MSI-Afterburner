Video prerecord hotkey
Allows defining global hotkey for starting and stopping video prerecording. During prerecording %PRODUCTNAME% is captures video and saves it in prerecord buffer in RAM or in temporary file. So prerecord buffer always contains the last few minutes of captured video. If you press video capture hotkey during prerecording then resulting video is being appended by prerecord buffer contents.

Hints:
- Enabling this option will cause additional %SERVERPRODUCTNAME% process to be automatically started. The server provides video capture services to 3D applications and it cannot be unloaded until this option is disabled.
- Some hotkey combinations (e.g. <1>...<5>, <Ctrl>+<1>...<Ctrl>+<5> and <Ctrl>+<D>) are reserved and cannot be used.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
