Push-To-Talk hotkey
Allows defining global hotkey for capturing audio in Push-To-Talk mode. When the hotkey is defined audio is being captured only when the hotkey is pressed.

Hints:
- Some hotkey combinations (e.g. <1>...<5>, <Ctrl>+<1>...<Ctrl>+<5> and <Ctrl>+<D>) are reserved and cannot be used.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
