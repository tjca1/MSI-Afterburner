Prerecord to file
Allows prerecord buffer to be stored in temporary file. This mode suits best for prerecording long videos (e.g. 10 minutes or more of H.264 video) or for prerecording videos with low compression ratio (e.g. lossless Lagarith video).

Hints:
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
