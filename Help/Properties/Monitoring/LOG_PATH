Log path
Displays and allows editing path to log file.

Hints:
- You may specify macro variables in the path. %ABDir% specifies current %PRODUCTNAME% installation folder and allows you to use logging with portable application usage scenarios, %Time% allows adding a timestamp to the filename.
- %PRODUCTNAME% saves history in native RivaTuner log file format. You may use either built-in viewer or RivaTuner to view log files recorded with %PRODUCTNAME%. 
- Hardware monitoring history logging is not absolutely free in terms of performance, some CPU time is required on each log update iteration to flush data to HDD. 
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
