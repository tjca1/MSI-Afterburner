Show in On-Screen Display
Allows showing currently selected graph values in the On-Screen Display.

Hints:
- You must activate and select desired graph to get access to this option.
- On-Screen Display rendering is not free in terms of performance, each displayed symbol requires both CPU and GPU resources. So try to avoid displaying unnecessary information in the On-Screen Display in order to minimize the performance hit.
- Enabling this option will cause additional %SERVERPRODUCTNAME% process to be automatically started. The server provides On-Screen Display rendering services to 3D applications and it cannot be unloaded until you disable On-Screen Display output for all graphs.
- You may hold <Shift> button pressed on your keyboard while changing this option to change it synchronically for all graphs.
- When multiple graphs are selected this option is changed synchronically for all selected graphs. In this case you may hold <Ctrl> button pressed on your keyboard while changing this option to change it for focused graph only.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
