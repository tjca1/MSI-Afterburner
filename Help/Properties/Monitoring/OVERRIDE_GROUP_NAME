Override group name
By default the values displayed in the On-Screen Display and Logitech keyboard LCD display are groupped by short sensor name. This option allows overriding default group names. 

Hints:
- Single symbol group names can be used to group values without displaying a group name.
- You may hold <Shift> button pressed on your keyboard while changing this option to change it synchronically for all graphs.
- When multiple graphs are selected this option is changed synchronically for all selected graphs. In this case you may hold <Ctrl> button pressed on your keyboard while changing this option or <Ctrl>+<M> inside the edit field to change it for focused graph only.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
