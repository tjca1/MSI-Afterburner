Memory voltage
Displays the current master GPU memory voltage. Depending on graphics card model the voltage can be represented either excplicitly or as an offset added to base voltage. Signed values represent the offset whilst unsigned values represent absolute voltage.

Hints:
- Voltage control is locked by default due to safety reasons. If you understand and accept the risks of using voltage control you can unlock it in advanced application properties.
- When GPU settings synchronization mode is enabled in <General> tab in advanced properties, any changes applied to the master GPU are also applied to all similar GPUs installed in the system.
- Voltage control is available on limited set of graphics card models equipped with programmable voltage regulation module. Please refer to documentation to get full list of graphic card models supporting voltage adjustments.
- You may click this field to directly type in a desired voltage.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
