User define
Enables user defined software automatic fan control mode. In this mode software periodically checks GPU temperature and sets new fan speed according to the fan speed curve, defined in the <Fan> tab in advanced properties.

Hints:
- Fan speed control is not available if graphics card is not equipped with fan controller chip and (or) controllable cooling system.
- Software automatic fan speed curve is not affected by the profiles, it is a global setting for all GPUs installed in the system. 
- When user defined software automatic fan control mode is enabled you can still switch between automatic and manual fan speed control modes using <Auto> button.
- You may disable user interface tooltips via <User interface> tab in advanced properties.
